# Dictionary Web App

This app is my solution to the Frontend Mentor Challenge [Dictionary Web App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL).

## Built Using:

- react
- [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
- axios 
- sass
- grid & flexbox
- sematic HTML


## Free Dictionary API:

- Root endpoint (English) - https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/
- Word endpoint - https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/hello

## The Challenge:

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
